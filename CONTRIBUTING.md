# Contributing to the DO Python Client

>First: if you're unsure or afraid of anything, just ask or submit the issue or pull request anyways. You won't be yelled at for giving your best effort. The worst that can happen is that you'll be politely asked to change something. We appreciate all contributions!

## A Little Bit of Context

The DigitalOcean Python client is generated using [AutoRest](https://github.com/Azure/autorest). The AutoRest tool generates client libraries for accessing RESTful web services. Input to AutoRest is a spec that describes the DigitalOcean REST API using the OpenAPI 3.0 Specification format. The spec can be found [here](https://github.com/digitalocean/openapi). AutoRest allows customizations to be made on top of the generated code.

## Generating PyDo Locally

PyDo is a generated client. This section will walk you through generating the client locally. One might ask, when would one want to generate PyDo locally? Local generation is really helpful when making changes to the client configuration itself. It is good practice to re-generate the client to ensure the behavior is as expected.

### Prerequisites

* Python version: >= 3.9 (it's highly recommended to use a python version management tool)
* [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/): python packaging and dependency management
* [AutoRest](https://github.com/Azure/autorest): The tool that generates the client libraries for accessing RESTful web services.

### Optional but highly recommended

We chose not to tie this repository to tooling for managing python installations. This allows developers to use their preferred tooling.

We like these:

* [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv): python version management
  * [pyenv-virtualenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv):
  a pyenv plugin to enable pyenv to manage virtualenvs for development
  environment isolation

### Setup

1. Clone this repository. Run:

    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:digitalocean/pydo.git
    cd pydo
    ```

2. (Optional) Ensure you have the right version of python installed using your preferred python version manager. This is what you'd run if you used `pyenv`:

    ```sh
    pyenv install 3.9.4
    ```

    This can take a few minutes.

3. Install the package dependencies

    ```sh
    poetry install
    ```

4. You can now activate your virtual environment

    ```sh
    poetry shell
    ```

### Using `make` commands to re-generate the client

1. Remove the previous generated code.

    ```sh
    make clean
    ```

2. Re-download the latest DO OpenAPI 3.0 Specification.

    ```sh
    make download-spec
    ```

3. Generate the client

    ```sh
    make generate
    ```

    It is also good practice to run mock tests against the changes using the following make command:

    ```sh
    make test-mocked
    ```

## Customizing the Client Using Patch Files

On top of generating our client, we've added a few customizations to create an optimal user experience. These customizations can by making changes to the `_patch.py` file. To learn more about adding customizations, please follow Autorest's documentation for it [here](https://github.com/Azure/autorest.python/blob/autorestv3/docs/customizations.md)

## Releasing `pydo`

The repo uses GitHub workflows to publish a draft release when a new tag is
pushed. We use [semver](https://semver.org/#summary) to determine the version
number vor the tag.

*Before pushing a tag*, the pyproject version needs to be bumped.

1. Run `make changes` to review the merged PRs since last release.
    * Review the tags on each PR and make sure they are categorized
      appropriately.
2. Determine the bump type (major, minor, patch).
3. Run `BUMP=(bugfix|feature|breaking) make bump_version` to update the `pydo`
   version.
    * `BUMP` also accepts `(patch|minor|major)`
4. Run `make generate` to update the version in the codebase.
5. Make a pull request with this change. It should be separate from PRs
   containing changes to the library (including regenerated code).
6. *Once the version bump PR has been pushed and merged*, tag the commit to trigger the
   release workflow.
   Run `make tag` to tag the latest commit and push the tag to ORIGIN.
    * To tag an earlier commit, run `COMMIT=${commit} make tag`.
    * To push the tag to a different remote, run `ORIGIN=${REMOTE} make tag`.
7. Once the release process completes, review the draft release for correctness
   and publish the release. Also, ensure the release has been marked `Latest`.
