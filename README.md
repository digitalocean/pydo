# digitalocean-python-client

`digitalocean-python-client` is the official python client library that allows
python developers to interact with and manage their DigitalOcean account
resources through the
[DigitalOcean API](https://developers.digitalocean.com/documentation/v2/).

# Purpose

To provide a "DO simple" Python API for interacting with and managing
DigitalOcean resources.

A top priority of this project is to ensure the client abides by the API
contract. Therefore, the client itself wraps a generated client based
on the [DigitalOcean OpenAPI Specification](https://github.com/digitalocean/openapi).
